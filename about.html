                        The Office, also known as The Office: An American Workplace is a 30 minute-long sitcom produced by the Deedle-Dee Productions and Reveille Productions in association with NBC.
                        It is based on the British series of the same name that was created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant and was adapted for American audiences by producer Greg Daniels. 
                        The pilot first premiered on television on March 24, 2005.

                        The Office was met with mixed reviews during its short first season, but the following seasons, especially those featuring Carell, received considerable acclaim from television critics. 
                        These seasons were included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards such as a Peabody Award in 2006, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, 
                        a Golden Globe Award for Carell's performance, and four Primetime Emmy Awards, including one for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2006.
                        Later seasons were criticized for a decline in quality, with many seeing Carell's departure in season seven as a contributing factor; however,
                        the final season ended the series' run with a generally positive response. 
                        The series finale was viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers, followed by an hour-long series retrospective.

                        To simulate the look of an actual documentary it was filmed in a single-camera setup without a studio audience or a laugh track.
